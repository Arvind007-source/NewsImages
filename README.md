Abstract
 As the consumption of news content becomes increasingly visual, the evaluation of news images
 plays a pivotal role in media understanding and interpretation. This research addresses the challenges
 associated with the automated assessment of news images with the mapping of textual information
 using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The work leverages a comprehensive dataset of news
 images and proposes a CNN architecture tailored to the intricacies of media content. The research first
 delves into the existing landscape of news image evaluation, highlighting gaps and limitations in current
 methodologies. Motivated by the need for robust and efficient image assessment tools, our work focuses
 on the design and implementation of a CNN tailored for news media.
